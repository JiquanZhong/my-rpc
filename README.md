1. Why Implement an RPC Project on my Own

RPC is a crucial architecture in distributed systems, allowing remote processes to execute method calls as though they were in a local process. This offers an efficient way to write code across machines. However, most RPC implementations rely on some form of serialization and deserialization mechanisms such as XML, JSON, or binary, requiring us to understand concepts like serialization, deserialization, and network communication. Moreover, most RPC implementations include advanced features like load balancing, automatic retries, and failover, all of which demand a deep understanding of system design, concurrent programming, and network communication. By implementing our own RPC framework, we can delve deeper into these concepts and learn many practical skills in the actual coding process.

2. Contents of the my-rpc Project

The my-rpc project will include the following:
- Implementation of a simple RPC framework, encompassing basic mechanisms like serialization, deserialization, and network communication.
- Implementation of load balancing, including strategies like round-robin, least active requests, etc.
- Implementation of automatic retries and failover, including network interruption detection, service recovery mechanisms, etc.
- Testing framework for writing and running test cases to verify the correctness of the RPC framework.
- Documentation and examples to help users understand and use my-rpc.

3. Requirements for the my-rpc Project

The following knowledge and skills are required:
- Proficiency in programming languages (such as Python, Java, etc).
- Familiarity with network communication protocols (like TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc).
- Understanding of concurrent programming.
- Familiarity with common serialization and deserialization mechanisms.
